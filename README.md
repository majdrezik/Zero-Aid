# Zero-Aid
UltraHack2020 project

This is the source code of our UltraHack2020 project: a Tsofen Hackathon, which is a resizable, touch finger-ring made especially to help elders
with medical care when they're home alone.
For example, if an old person fell in the bathroom and he/she is home alone, they can simply ask for help by touching the ring twice,
one long touch; another short one. 
The signal will get to the dedicated organization and they'll send help in no time.
